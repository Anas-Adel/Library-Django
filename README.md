A full-stack Library Management Web App that enables users to search and borrow books, while admins can manage the book inventory (add, update, remove).

🔑 Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure login and sign-up with form validations.
Admin control: Admins can manage book inventory: add, edit, or remove books.
Search System: Find books by title, author, or category.
Borrowing & Returning: Users can borrow and return books without conflicts.

🔧 Tech Stack:
Backend: Django (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no framework)
Deployment: PythonAnywhere (Free hosting)

🚀 Challenges & Learnings:
This project gave me hands-on experience across the full development lifecycle — from designing database models and backend logic to building the frontend interface. Deploying the app introduced real-world challenges like managing static files, configuring environment variables, and debugging production issues.
